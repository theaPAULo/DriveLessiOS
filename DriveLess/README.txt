📊 Current Status & Performance
Working Features

✅ Google Maps integration with custom markers
✅ Route optimization with traffic consideration
✅ Location autocomplete with intelligent suggestions
✅ Current location detection and usage
✅ Round trip functionality
✅ Export to Google Maps/Apple Maps
✅ Responsive design for iPhone/iPad

Known Issues & Limitations
